# DIGIT-RECOGNITION

## MOTIVATION:
* The handwritten digit recognition can play a huge role in increasing the speed of the postal systems.
* The letters can be segregated based on the PIN code using this model.

## TASK:
* In this project we classify handwritten digits using deep learning.

## DATASET:
* The data used here is taken from Tensorflow datasets. To access the dataset click [here.](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/mnist)

## TRAIN and TEST DATA:

|DATA               | SAMPLE SIZE  |
|----               | -----        |
|Train_data         | 60,000       |
|Test_data          | 10,000

## IMAGE PIXELS:
* The image in this dataset are grayscale images. The dimension of each image is (28,28,3).
* The height and width of the image is equal to 28.
* Number of channels in the image is 1.

## NEURAL_NETWORK ARCHITECTURE:
* In this project we made use of the convolutional neural network.
* The convolutional network architecture is LENET-5.
* LENET-5 is one of the best architecture used for grayscale images.
